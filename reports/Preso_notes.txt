Visuals = good
Don’t skip over TOC
Love the research question
Highlighting the problem: good
Quotes: good design + paraphrase – no need to make this a political debate. Just lightly say the context and move on.
Dataset slide: slow down and be clearer. 
“This is a dataset that looks at rideshare usage in NYC. The idea is to optimize bus routes by gauging demand through a dataset of rideshare users, where they’re coming from, and where they’re going to. Basically: we want the bus to pick up these people instead of them calling an Uber or Lyft.”
Processing: good
Most rides are short: emphasize this – it’s important
Pandemic decline/recovery: be clearer in how this will figure into final conclusions
Tale of two cities: it’s a deviation…put it at the end :(
Stability EDA: highlight  rows that matter (one that stays the same, one that changes, and one that changes in covid and goes back to normal). Maybe keep it to 20 rows. 
Process: good
Network: fine…not everyone will understand it, but it’s necessary
Shortest path: good!
Custom algo: good
Running the model: good and loved the visuals
Add conclusion summary slide
Conclusions: drive point 1 stronger: don’t need a continuous planning process but a solid and on-time delivery every 5 years. Highlight in color most important words.
Add a resource slide
Add next steps slide
